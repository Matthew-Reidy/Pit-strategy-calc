0.0.8:
	Added Configuration window under Config -> Telemetry Settings
		There you will find options for enabling or dissabling the following:
			Automatic Telemetry Gathering
			Automatic Resetting of Laps
				Automatic Resetting of fuel calculations
		(none of these options are permanent yet, they have to be reset each time you launch the program)
	Added Correction to the estimated laps value used in fuel calculation to prevent skew as you travel through the lap
		This means that the app should calculate using the time when you crossed the timing line
0.0.9:
	Added Settings Persistence
		Written to settings.xml
		Program will load defaults on first launch, then load them from settings.xml.
			Be careful editing because you can break reading the settings from the file by corrupting the xml structure
	Some refinements to the light/dark mode have been made
		some further refinements to the light mode have yet to be made
